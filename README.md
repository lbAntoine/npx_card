# NPX CARD

This is my NPX card to connect with me directly via console or terminal.

Just type ðŸ‘‡

```bash
npx lbantoine
```

and get my business card with everything you need to contact me.

### This card is heavily inspired by [anmol's npx card](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card). Most of the credits goes to him and building this project following his idea was fun.
